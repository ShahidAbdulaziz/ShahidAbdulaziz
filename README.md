### Data Scientist 
Currently, I am a Data Scientist with my Masterâ€™s in Data Science and soon to be second Masters in Software Development. Additionally, I run my own Data Science and Software Development consulting company called AZ Data Consulting. Consulting/contracting allows me to address extensive data issues across a variety of areas, which I enjoy. I love creating storybooks from data that anyone can interpret and understand. Most importantly, I know every problem does not require a Machine Learning Model. Often, a simpler root is the most efficient path.
